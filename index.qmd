Welcome to my website! I am a Junior at Rice University majoring in Statistics and Sport Analytics, with minors in Data Science and Financial Computation and Modeling.

I am a mathematically-oriented thinker interested in using data to solve complex problems in the real-world. My career interests lie in sport analytics, quantitative finance, and data science. Throughout my coursework, internships, and passion projects, I have developed skills in R, Python, and SQL. 

In my free time, you can find me playing basketball, chess, and cooking. Please have a look around my website, and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or want to connect!
