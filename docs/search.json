After one semester, I transitioned into recruiting and scouting, where I evaluated prospects through extensive video review and led official/unofficial visits for recruits and their families.\nBy my sophomore year, I helped build out Rice’s first student-led analytics department, which has since grown from just 2 people to a team of 12. In this role, I’ve led projects that directly supported coaches and recruiting staff, including:\n\nDeveloping analytics-based scouting reports for weekly opponents.\nCreating machine learning models to project transfer portal entries and estimate the likelihood of players transferring to Rice.\nDesigning a R Shiny web application to automate opponent scouting processes.\nAssisting in the evaluation of every Texas Class of 2024 high school prospect.\n\nThis experience has given me hands-on exposure to multiple aspects of a Division I football program (video operations, recruiting, scouting, and analytics) while also allowing me to lead and mentor a growing team of student analysts."

Using a mixed-effects logistic regression model, I:\n\nQuantified how play context, quarterback tendencies, and defensive pressure contribute to batted passes.\nGenerated quarterback rankings based on random effect estimates of their ability to avoid batted passes.\nProduced a full paper, poster, and presentation, which I presented at the 2024 Carnegie Mellon Sports Analytics Conference.\n\nThis experience deepened my skills in hierarchical modeling, statistical inference, and communicating results to both technical and non-technical audiences."

My role combined traditional film breakdown with analytics-based research, producing insights that were used in client recruitment and representation.\nHighlights:\n\nAuthored 15+ video and written scouting reports that blended film study with statistical analysis, used in player meetings. You can find an example written report here as well as an example video here.\nEvaluated prospects with Synergy Sports data to project NBA success and long-term earning potential.\nExpanded the agency’s prospect database by adding 50+ players, each with detailed evaluations and backgrounds.\nConducted market research on NBA free agency moves, identifying ideal destinations and opportunities for clients.\nDesigned an in-depth pitch deck for a prospective NBA client that was presented in agency meetings.\n\nThis experience gave me a close look at the business and strategy side of basketball, while allowing me to contribute meaningfully to scouting and player evaluation processes."
